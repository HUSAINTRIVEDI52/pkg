# Developer Handover: `cs-setup` Package Fixes

## 📦 Package Context
`cs-setup` (managed in the `pkg` repository) is a CLI tool designed to standardize DevOps and CI/CD workflows. It automatically configures:
- **Husky Hooks** (Pre-commit for linting/leaks, Pre-push for tests)
- **Security Scanning** (Gitleaks)
- **Quality Analysis** (SonarQube)
- **Automated Testing** (Vitest smoke tests and Newman API tests)

---

## 🛠 Fixes Implemented

### 1. Robust Dependency Detection
- **Issue:** The tool failed to recognize dependencies as "already installed" if they included a version tag (e.g., `@vitest/coverage-v8@^1.4.0`). This caused unnecessary re-installations and errors.
- **Change:** 
    - Added `getPackageBaseName` helper in `lib/packageManager.js` to correctly strip version tags from both standard and scoped (`@scope/package`) names.
    - Updated `installDevDependency` to use this base name when checking `package.json` and the `node_modules/` folder.
- **Outcome:** `npx cs-setup check-hooks` now correctly identifies existing packages and avoids redundant `npm install` calls.

### 2. Pre-push Branch Deletion Skip
- **Issue:** Running `git push origin --delete branch` would trigger full CI checks/smoke tests, which is unnecessary and often blocked by environment-specific test failures.
- **Change:**
    - Modified `lib/ci.js` to update the `buildPrePushHook` template.
    - Added logic to read Git's `stdin` (`<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>`).
    - The hook now detects a "deletion push" by checking for the zero-SHA (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`).
- **Outcome:** Branch deletions now skip CI checks with a message: `[Pre-push] Deletion detected. Skipping CI checks.`.

## 🚀 How to Apply Changes
To apply these fixes in a target project, developers should:
1. Update the `cs-setup` package:
   ```bash
   npm install github:HUSAINTRIVEDI52/pkg#Latest-testing
   ```
2. Re-generate the hooks to apply the new templates:
   ```bash
   npx cs-setup check-hooks
   ```
